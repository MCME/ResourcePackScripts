generate vanilla resource pack files from sodium files
- for each .json model file in mcme/models/block
    + create a list of all needed rotations (axis and angle) by checking each blockstate file linking this model file
    + for each rotation run objmc script with optional settings from .objmeta file to create vanilla model and texture with vertex data
    - shape output texture to be power of 2 (in objmc script?)
    - create vanilla blockstate file from sodium blockstate file by replacing rotations with rotated vanilla models
